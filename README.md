### Harmful Algal Bloom Prediction Models Using Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains the code from the paper "Harmful Algal Bloom Prediction Models Using Convolutional Neural Network", by Sangwon Chae, Beomhui Lee, Sungjun Kwon, Sungwon Kang, Donghyun Lee.
In order to make this code run you will have to download and install the neural networks we have considered.

> **Data pre-processing**

The eight types of water-quality data collected from water-quality monitoring stations operated by the National Institute of Environment Research in South Korea (http://www.koreawqi.go.kr/index_web.jsp) were used. In addition, four types of weather data collected from the ASOSs operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (https://data.kma.go.kr/data/grnd/selectAsosRltmList.do) were used.
